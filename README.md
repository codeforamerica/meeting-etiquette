Code for America Meeting Etiquette
=====

These are good rules to follow when booking meetings at CfA. Submit an issue or create a pull request to suggest changes.

### 1. Default to 30 minutes.
Don't start at an hour. If it's an hour long, it should be a working meeting.

### 2. Describe why you're having the meeting.
If you don't include an agenda, include bullet points about what you want to get done. Calling the meeting "Check in on X" is not enough.

### 3. Tell invitees why you want them there.
If it isn't immediately clear, tell invitees why they're in the meeting in the descroption field. 

If they're optional, let them know by hovering over their icon in Gcal and clicking:

![Show invitee they're optional]()

### 4. Start and end on time.
* If you're going to be late, contact the group and let them know. (Slack is good.)
* If it looks like you're going over time, announce it during the meeting and give others the option to leave.

**Optional Pro-tips**

* **Add in buffer time to the end of your meetings.** End 30 minute meetings 5 minutes early. End 1 hour meetings 10 minutes early. 

You can do it by default in Google Calendar:
